## Digital Communication Protocol
Almost every sensor, communicator, or driver electronic on the Icarus uses a digital communication protocol for sending or recieving data. Since this is true, we had to use various libraries for communicating in different protocols, including:
- CAN
- USB
- IÂ²C
- UART
